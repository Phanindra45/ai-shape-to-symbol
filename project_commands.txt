AI Shape → Editable Symbol Converter

Project Description:
This project converts any uploaded shape image into a clean, reusable, and editable symbol using AI-based image processing. 
Unlike simple vector tracing, the system abstracts the shape by removing noise and simplifying contours, producing a true symbol representation.

Key Features:
1. Upload any shape image (freeform or industrial).
2. Automatically preprocess and extract the main shape.
3. Simplify contours to remove scribbles and unnecessary details.
4. Convert the shape into a clean symbol outline.
5. Allow user editing:
   - Symbol size (scale)
   - Stroke width
   - Stroke color
   - Fill color
6. Display a live editable symbol preview.
7. Generate a symbol data model with custom properties.

Technology Used:
- Python
- Streamlit (UI)
- OpenCV (image processing)
- NumPy
- Pillow

How to Run the Project:
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy pillow

2. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py

3. Open browser at:
   http://localhost:8501

Deployment:
The project can be deployed using Streamlit Cloud and shared as a public URL.

Use Case:
The system is useful for symbol creation in design tools, diagram editors, P&ID symbols, and reusable graphic assets.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how AI-based contour processing can transform raw shapes into clean, editable symbols with user-controlled properties.
